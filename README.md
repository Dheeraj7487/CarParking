# CarParking
The proposed project is a smart parking booking system that provides customers an easy way of reserving a
parking space online. It overcomes the problem of finding a parking space in commercial areas that unnecessary
consumes time. Hence this project offers a android-based reservation system where users can view various
parking areas and select the space to view whether space is available or not. If the booking space is available then
he can book it for specific time slot. The booked status will be represent as booked and will not be available for
anyone else for the specified time. This system provides an additional feature of cancelling the bookings. User
can cancel their books space anytime. Users can even make payment online. After making payment users are
notified about the booking along with unique parking number.
